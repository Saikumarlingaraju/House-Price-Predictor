# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing! A few guidelines to make contributions smooth.

How to contribute
1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
```
2. Run tests and linters locally before creating a PR.
3. Open a PR describing the change, linking any relevant issue.

Code style
- Use Black for formatting and flake8 for linting.
- Keep functions small and testable.

Reporting issues
- Create issues with a minimal reproduction and a clear title.

Pull requests
- Write descriptive commit messages.
- Add tests for new behavior where applicable.

Maintainers: If you are the repo owner, merge approved PRs and keep the CHANGELOG updated.
